This portfolio website was developed to showcase my skills, projects, and background in a clean and organized manner. Using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, I created different sections like Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact. I focused on making the design responsive and user-friendly across devices. This project gave me hands-on experience with front-end development and allowed me to create a professional platform to represent myself.
